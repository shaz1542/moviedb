# moviedb
Ruby and rails application to demonstrate API calls and sorting 



Rails version:6.0.1 
Ruby version: 2.5.7
mysql:5.7.11


Setup:

Have a database called movies_development
have the root user with no password, you may have your custom user and configure the credentials in the database.yml file.

run bundle install // installs all the gems
run db:migrate //to create the tables
run db:seed    //to load the sample data
run rails server //to start the server

goto localhost:3000/movies from browser


Future improvements,
I would Idealy finish the remaining CRUD operations and provide the interfaces for the creating, editing and deleting the movies the Movies
We can also host the projecct in heroku
I would also have mysql scripts for creating the database
I would also have mysql scripts for creating the database user and granting him the privileges on the database scripts
